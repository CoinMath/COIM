## **Features**

### **1. Mining**
CoinMath offers an accessible mining process for its native token, **COIM**. With a one-tap mining feature in the mobile app, users can earn tokens with minimal technical knowledge. The mining mechanism is designed to be efficient, ensuring that users can continuously earn without needing expensive hardware.

### **2. Staking**
Stake your **COIM** tokens to participate in the staking rewards program. CoinMath provides multiple staking tiers with varying lockup periods and reward percentages, allowing users to choose a strategy that aligns with their goals. The longer the lock-up period, the higher the potential rewards.

### **3. Liquidity Provision**
CoinMath encourages users to provide liquidity for the COIM token on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap. By providing liquidity, users can earn trading fees while contributing to the overall stability and liquidity of the token.

### **4. Referral Program**
CoinMath incentivizes user growth through a referral program. Users who refer others can increase their mining rate by 10%, calculated using the formula:
  
  \[
  \text{Mining Rate} = 0.14 \times (\text{Referral Number} \times 1.1)
  \]

This program rewards users for growing the community, with additional $COIM rewards for each successful referral.
